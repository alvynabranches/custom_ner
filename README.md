# Custom Named Entity Recognition

In this repository I will be building a custom NER that will have entities like Job Timing (JT), Organization (ORG), Job Role (JR), Job Skill (JS), Qualification (QN), Documents (DOC), Programming Language (PL), Programming Framework (PF), etc. The dataset used for this experiment is fully customized by me and will be included in the repository. The data is gained from webscraping from different job sites. I will be only using their job description and not other data available from the website. 

The data was mostly scraped from indeed previously and some other websites could be added.
